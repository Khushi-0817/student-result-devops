\# Git Workflow



The project uses Git for version control with a command-line based workflow.



git init

git add .

git commit -m "message"

git branch -M main

git remote add origin <repo-url>

git push -u origin main





This workflow ensures version tracking, collaboration readiness, and CI/CD compatibility.
